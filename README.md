## Installation
To run this project, you need to have Python 3 and the following libraries installed:

pandas
matplotlib
seaborn
plotly
gensim
emojis
.

.
To run this project, you may need to install the required libraries using pip. In this project, I used Jupyter Notebook provided by Anaconda and installed various libraries to analyze my WhatsApp group data.



## Data Cleaning
To analyze the WhatsApp group chat data, the first step was to clean the raw data. This involved loading the data into a pandas DataFrame and performing various cleaning operations.

Removing empty messages
* Extracting the date and time of each message
* Identifying the author of each message
* These cleaning operations were necessary to prepare the data for further analysis and visualization.



## Data Privacy
For data privacy, the phone numbers of the WhatsApp group members are encrypted using a hash function.



## Exploratory Data Analysis
Once the data is cleaned, exploratory data analysis is performed to gain insights into the patterns and trends of the group's communication. This includes analyzing the number of messages per hour, per day, and per month, identifying the most active members of the group, and analyzing the distribution of emojis used in the messages.



## Data Visualization
Finally, the data is visualized using various libraries such as matplotlib, seaborn, and plotly. The visualizations include bar charts, line plots, heatmaps, and pie charts. Note that some of the interactive plots may not be visible in this repository.



## Conclusion
This project provides valuable insights into the communication patterns and trends of the WhatsApp group. The analysis shows that certain members are more active than others, and certain topics are discussed more frequently than others. The project also highlights the importance of data cleaning and visualization in the analysis of raw data.
